Pearson's Correlation


In statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient is a linear measure between
two quantitative random variables. Unlike covariance, Pearson's correlation
is independent of the scale of measurement of the variables.
A Pearson correlation is a number between -1 and 1 that indicates the extent
 to which two variables are linearly related. The Pearson correlation is also 
 known as the “product moment correlation coefficient” (PMCC) or simply “correlation”.

it is used to group data, in this case we have 3 points a, b, c where group a is a type
of color like red and b is another type like green to which color does c belong if we 
go in the distance at a smaller distance is the one that belongs
